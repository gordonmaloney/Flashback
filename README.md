Flashback is a flashcard app, built using the MERN stack.

It uses a spaced repetition system, similar to programs like Anki, to optimise retention.

It has a 'user' side, where users can drill their cards, as well as add/remove/edit cards.

And an 'admin' side, where an admin - for example a teacher - can see their students' progress and add cards to their decks, either individually or in bulk.

For instance, a language teacher could push lists of vocabulary to their students' decks after each language class.
